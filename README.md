# Password-Generator

This application focuses on the use of Javascript to generate a random, secure password for the user. 

## Getting Started

This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To get this project up and running, you can follow the deployment link. 

### This project has the following features: 
* A generate button
    * This will send the user a series of prompts to validate choices for password criteria
    * After user choices are complete, the user will get a randomly generated password to copy to their clipboard

* A Copy button 
    * This will copy the randomly generated password to the user's clipboard

### Project Requirements: 
* The user will be prompted to select from the following password criteria: 
    * The generated password must be between 8 and 128 characters
* The user will be prompted to validate: 
    * Password containing uppercase, lowercase, special characters, numbers
    * This will randomly generate a selection or randomly select array data, so math.random and math.floor will need to be used.     
* The application confirms user input and ensures that at least one character type is selected. 
* Once all prompts are complete, the user will be presented with a password fitting the user password criteria.

### Project script includes:
* A variable declaration area 
* An event listener (onclick) called generatePassword
    * This will prompt the user for input between 8-128
    * This variable is changed to an interger using ParseInt()
    * This will confirm that the input is a number and within the range
    * This then uses the input to determine the types of letters or characters used, using an if statement
    * This then assigns values to the variables using arrays for special characters, numbers or the alphabet
* Another variable is created to concatenate these variables into a single password
* A for loop will iterate through the generate prompt until it reaches the number of characters entered by user 
* A password variable then takes the value from the for loop, and converts it to a string
* Then the string populates into the text area for the user
* An event listener (onlick) for copying the string to the user's clipboard confirms the string is on the clipboard
